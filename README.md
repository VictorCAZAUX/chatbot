How to use : 

To start using Caroline, you have to call her because she is at the other end of the store. So start by saying "Hello" or "Hi" to call her.
Caroline offers you if you want to buy or consult clothes. Answer her according to your choice.
Then choose the item you want to see: T-Shirt, pants, sweatshirts... then maybe the color and so, Caroline will go and look if there are any items in stock that 
might interest you.
Caroline will provide you with all the information if you want to buy the item (link to the merchant site)
or even if you just want to view it (direct link to the image).
